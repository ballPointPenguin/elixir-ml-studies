## Libraries

### Python

* **tensorflow** - building and deploying machine learning models
* **PyTorch** - building and training ML models, including deep learning
* **pandas** - data manipulation and analysis, including the DataFrame and Series data structures
* **NumPy** - numerical operations (arrays, matrices, linear algebra)
* **SciPy** - scientific & technical computing (e.g. signal & image processing)
* **scikit-learn** - algorithms for classification, clustering, regressions, etc
* **Keras** - building deep learning models

#### Anaconda

* Anaconda is a distribution of Python and includes both Python and many commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. Anaconda also includes a package and environment manager, called conda, which allows you to manage multiple environments and install packages. With conda, you can create isolated environments that contain specific versions of Python and packages. This helps ensure that your projects are not affected by updates or changes to other packages and makes it easy to reproduce your environment in another location.

### Torch

An ML library and scripting language (based on Lua: LuiJIT). Released in 2002. defunct. Use PyTorch now.

### Elixir

#### Nx

* a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU

The Nx Repo holds 3 projects:

* **Nx** - Multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions
* **EXLA** - Google's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler/backend for Nx
* **Torchx** - LibTorch backend for Nx

The elixir-nx organization hosts other repos including:

* **axon** - Nx-powered neural networks
* **bumblebee** - pre-trained and transformer Neural Network models in axon
* **explorer** - series (one-dimensional) and dataframes (two-dimensional) for fast data exploration to Elixir. (maybe like pandas?)
* **ex_faiss** - Elixir front-end for Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

### rust

* **polars** - blazingly fast dataframe library

### R

* **dplyr** - a grammar of data manipulation
