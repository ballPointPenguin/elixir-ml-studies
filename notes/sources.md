### Papers

_ChatGPT:_

> Here are some foundational papers in deep learning:
>
> * "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" by Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner (1998). This paper introduced the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition.
> * "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton (2012). This paper revolutionized the field of computer vision by demonstrating the power of deep learning and convolutional neural networks on large-scale image recognition.
> * "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun (2015). This paper introduced the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which is widely used in computer vision today.
> * "Generative Adversarial Networks" by Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio (2014). This paper introduced the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are now widely used for image synthesis and other generative tasks.
> * "Long Short-Term Memory" by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber (1997). This paper introduced the concept of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are widely used for sequence modeling tasks such as language translation and speech recognition.
>   These papers are considered the foundation of deep learning and are widely cited in the field.
