## Deep Learning

Regular machine learning typically uses simpler models such as linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees, that are based on a small number of features and/or a small number of layers. These models are relatively easy to interpret, and they are often used for problems that have a small amount of data or that require a simple model.

Deep learning, on the other hand, uses more complex models such as deep neural networks, which are composed of a large number of layers, often more than 10 layers. These models are more difficult to interpret, but they are able to automatically learn high-level representations of the data and to model complex non-linear relationships between the input and the output. Deep learning models are particularly useful for problems that have a large amount of data, or that require a high degree of complexity, such as image or speech recognition, natural language processing, or self-driving cars.
